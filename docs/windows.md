# Helm on Windows

## Install

Download `Helm-<version>-x86_64-Setup.exe` (or the `aarch64` installer on an
Arm device) from [github.com/vverma022/helm/releases](https://github.com/vverma022/helm/releases/latest/download/) or the
[GitHub release](https://github.com/vverma022/helm/releases) and run it. It
installs per-user into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Helm`, so it never asks for
administrator rights — which is also what lets Helm update itself later
without a UAC prompt.

`https://github.com/vverma022/helm/releases/latest/download/latest-windows.txt` names the current version if you
want to script the download.

### Portable

`helm-<version>-<target>.zip` is the same build without an installer. Unpack it
anywhere and run `helm.exe`.

**Keep the two executables together.** Helm launches `helm-daemon.exe` from its
own directory, so moving `helm.exe` out on its own leaves it unable to start
the daemon. A shortcut is fine.

A portable copy still updates itself: the updater passes the running
directory to the installer, so it replaces that copy in place rather than
creating a second install.

Helm expects:

- **Windows 10 version 1809 or newer**, or Windows 11.
- **A Direct3D 11 driver at feature level 11_0 or newer.** GPUI renders
  through DirectX and falls back to the Microsoft Basic Render Driver, so it
  can run in a VM — see Troubleshooting if the window comes up black.
- **x86_64 or aarch64.**

Nothing else: Helm links the C runtime statically, so there is no Visual C++
redistributable to install first. That matters most on Arm devices, which
rarely have the arm64 redistributable already.

SmartScreen may warn about an unrecognized publisher on first launch when the
release was not code-signed. Choose **More info → Run anyway**.

## Updating

Helm updates itself. It checks once per launch, and an available update
appears in the sidebar footer; clicking it downloads the installer, verifies
its signature, and runs it. Helm closes, is replaced in place, and reopens.
Turn the check off in **Settings → General → Automatic updates** — **Check for
Updates…** in the app menu still works either way.

Updates are the same signed feed macOS uses, with one appcast per
architecture:

- `https://github.com/vverma022/helm/releases/latest/download/appcast-windows-x86_64.xml`
- `https://github.com/vverma022/helm/releases/latest/download/appcast-windows-aarch64.xml`

Every installer carries an EdDSA signature, and Helm refuses one that does not
verify against the public key built into it — so a compromised mirror or a
tampered download cannot install anything. The preference itself lives in
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Helm\updater.json`.

## Where Helm keeps its data

| What | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Tasks, sessions, transcripts | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Helm\app.db` |
| Attachments and blobs | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Helm\blobs` |
| Settings | `%USERPROFILE%\.helm\app.json` |

Unpacking a new release over the old directory leaves all of it untouched.

## Agent CLIs

Helm detects the provider CLIs on `PATH` and, because a fresh `PATH` may
predate an install, also looks in the usual per-user prefixes:
`%APPDATA%\npm`, `%USERPROFILE%\.bun\bin`, `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin`,
`%USERPROFILE%\scoop\shims`, and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsApps`.

Bare names resolve through `PATHEXT`, so the `claude.cmd` shim npm installs is
found the same way `claude` would be in a shell. Nothing is spawned with a
console window attached.

If a CLI is installed but not detected, set its path explicitly in
**Settings → Providers**.

## Terminal

The built-in terminal opens PowerShell 7 (`pwsh.exe`) when it is installed,
then Windows PowerShell, then whatever `COMSPEC` names. Ctrl+Shift+C and
Ctrl+Shift+V copy and paste so Ctrl+C stays available to the shell.

## Browser

The right panel's Browser tab runs on WebView2, which is in-box on Windows 11
and evergreen-installed on Windows 10. Navigation, devtools, downloads, and
pop-up handling behave as they do on macOS.

Helm hosts it in *visual* mode rather than as a child window: the page renders
into a DirectComposition visual that GPUI hands out between its own content
and its overlay plane, so menus, tooltips and dialogs composite above a live
page instead of hiding it. That is also why the browser needs a working
composition path — see the black-window note under Troubleshooting.

Differences worth knowing:

- **No load progress in the toolbar.** WebView2 reports no equivalent of
  WebKit's `estimatedProgress`, so the bar stays empty while a page loads.
- **Devtools open but do not toggle.** WebView2 offers no way to ask whether
  its devtools window is open, or to close it, so the shortcut only opens and
  refocuses it.
- **Pen, touch and dragging files into the page are not wired up.** Visual
  hosting delivers no input of its own; Helm forwards mouse, wheel, cursor and
  focus, and leaves `SendPointerInput` and the external drop target for later.
  Keyboard and IME are unaffected — those still reach the page directly once
  it holds focus.

## What is not available yet

- **Computer use.** The runtime and its UI stay disabled off macOS.
- **Terminals over the daemon's browser client.** The desktop terminal works;
  a remote browser client connected to a Windows daemon cannot open one.

## Troubleshooting

**The window opens black, or the app exits at startup.** Helm needs a working
Direct3D 11 device. Update the GPU driver; in a VM, enable 3D acceleration.

**A provider is listed as not installed.** Open a new PowerShell window and run
the CLI by name. If the shell cannot find it either, the install did not put a
shim on `PATH`. If the shell finds it but Helm does not, set the binary path in
**Settings → Providers** and file an issue with the install method.

**Git-backed features do nothing.** Helm shells out to `git`. Install Git for
Windows and make sure `git --version` works in a new terminal.

**The update never arrives.** Helm reaches the feed with the `curl.exe` in
System32; a proxy or filter that blocks `github.com/vverma022/helm/releases` blocks updates too.
**Check for Updates…** reports the reason, where the once-per-launch check
stays quiet. Downloading the installer by hand and running it is always
equivalent.
